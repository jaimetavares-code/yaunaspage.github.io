    <div class="birthday_message">  
        You're a wonderful friend and an amazing cookie!<img src="img/hp.png" width="30px"> <br>
        I hope you enjoy this lil present I did for chu, for you birthday, as much as I had coding it :D <br>
        I am not sure what I'll be doing next year o.o But I got this one covered :p <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I've prepared you 4 lil buttons, from left to right: a button that shows a birthday cake made out of vanilla :p<br>
        A button that shows a goofy short video you're gonna enjoy >:D<br>
        A dumb copypasta I really enjoy and you probably are aware of, if not, enjoy :p I find it really funny<br>
        And the final button, please press this one last, cause there's no way to implement a "way back" like the other buttons. You're gonna be "stuck" in this one, because it leads to another website xD you'll see when you open it <br>
        I may have not given you a physical gift, but you'll always have this website, which I can update whenever you'd like :p<br><br><br>
        PS: Tell your pups they're super cute and good bois and gals ^-^<br>
        PPS: Although this website works both for pc and phone, I recommend you browse this on pc, as it's easier to navigate o.o Phone should work though. <br>  Derp Randy, cause why not? xD
